// According to what reported in #152, for Microsoft Edge to fire the IntersectionObserver for an img element, it must have a size. Since imgs are displayed inline-block as standard, MS Edge (version not specified) doesn't read them correctly.
// By setting the following, edge is able to see the images and they get loaded.


img[data-src],
img[data-srcset] {
  display: block;
  min-height: 1px;
}
